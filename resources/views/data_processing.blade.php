                                             <li><strong>Data Retention for Analytical Purposes:</strong> Some data collected through user interactions (such as reviews, ratings, or behavioral data) may be retained for analytical purposes as long as they are relevant for platform analytics, trend analysis, or reporting. These data may be used to generate insights or reports and could be visible to other users or third parties involved in the analysis, even if the Service Provider or Platform User no longer uses the platform.</li>
                                             <li><strong>Platform User Data Visibility:</strong> For example, if a Platform User has posted a review or rating for a Service Provider, that review and rating may remain visible on the platform under the relevant Service Provider's profile, even if the Service Provider has deactivated or removed their profile. This ensures transparency and continuity in the visibility of past interactions.</li>
                                             <li><strong>Deletion and Anonymization:</strong> After legal requirements are fulfilled or the Service Provider's service has ended, data will be deleted, destroyed, or anonymized. However, data that has been used for generating anonymized reports or trends may be retained in aggregate form and remain accessible for analytical purposes.</li>
